Midi step sequencer for Android based on raw USB-Midi device support.

Important Notes
---------------

This is WORK IN PROGRESS. The app should run just fine, but there are millions of things to be done!

Contributors are very welcome, but at the moment, I cannot put too much effort into this project...


Technical Notes
---------------

Some good parts:

- USB midi seems to work quite stable
- Sequencer timing seems to be quite accurate (spent a lot of time on it...)
- User interface rendering based on pre-rendered bitmaps also seems to be reasonable fast

Areas to be improved:

- Anything related to user interface, settings, configuration, etc. (I am not an expert on Android UI)
- No time has been spent on memory/allocation optimization, didn't seem to be a hotspot right now
